<p class='center'>I.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>It was a story the pilot told, with his back to his hearers,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Keeping his hand on the wheel and his eye on the globe of the jack-staff,</p>
<p>Holding the boat to the shore and out of the sweep of the current,</p>
<p>Lightly turning aside for the heavy logs of the drift-wood,</p>
<p>Widely shunning the snags that made us sardonic obeisance.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>II.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>All the soft, damp air was full of delicate perfume</p>
<p>From the young willows in bloom on either bank of the river,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Faint, delicious fragrance, trancing the indolent senses</p>
<p>In a luxurious dream of the river and land of the lotus.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>Not yet out of the west the roses of sunset were withered;</p>
<p>In the deep blue above light clouds of gold and of crimson</p>
<p>Floated in slumber serene; and the restless river beneath them</p>
<p>Rushed away to the sea with a vision of rest in its bosom;</p>
<p>Far on the eastern shore lay dimly the swamps of the cypress;</p>
<p>Dimly before us the islands grew from the river&rsquo;s expanses,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Beautiful, wood-grown isles, with the gleam of the swart inundation</p>
<p>Seen through the swaying boughs and slender trunks of their willows;</p>
<p>And on the shore beside us the cotton-trees rose in the evening,</p>
<p>Phantom-like, yearningly, wearily, with the inscrutable sadness</p>
<p>Of the mute races of trees. While hoarsely the steam from her &rsquo;scape-pipes</p>
<p>Shouted, then whispered a moment, then shouted again to the silence,</p>
<p>Trembling through all her frame with the mighty pulse of her engines,</p>
<p>Slowly the boat ascended the swollen and broad Mississippi,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>Bank-full, sweeping on, with tangled masses of drift-wood,</p>
<p>Daintily breathed about with whiffs of silvery vapor,</p>
<p>Where in his arrowy flight the twittering swallow alighted,</p>
<p>And the belated blackbird paused on the way to its nestlings.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>III.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>It was the pilot&rsquo;s story:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;They both came aboard there, at Cairo,</p>
<p>From a New Orleans boat, and took passage with us for Saint Louis.</p>
<p>She was a beautiful woman, with just enough blood from her mother</p>
<p>Darkening her eyes and her hair to make her race known to a trader:</p>
<p>You would have thought she was white. The man that was with her,&ndash;&ndash;you see such,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Weakly good-natured and kind, and weakly good-natured and vicious,</p>
<p>Slender of body and soul, fit neither for loving nor hating.</p>
<p>I was a youngster then, and only learning the river,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Not over-fond of the wheel. I used to watch them at monte,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>Down in the cabin at night, and learned to know all of the gamblers.</p>
<p>So when I saw this weak one staking his money against them,</p>
<p>Betting upon the turn of the cards, I knew what was coming:</p>
<p><i>They</i> never left their pigeons a single feather to fly with.</p>
<p>Next day I saw them together,&ndash;&ndash;the stranger and one of the gamblers:</p>
<p>Picturesque rascal he was, with long black hair and moustaches,</p>
<p>Black slouch hat drawn down to his eyes from his villanous forehead.</p>
<p>On together they moved, still earnestly talking in whispers,</p>
<p>On toward the forecastle, where sat the woman alone by the gangway.</p>
<p>Roused by the fall of feet, she turned, and, beholding her master,</p>
<p>Greeted him with a smile that was more like a wife&rsquo;s than another&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>Rose to meet him fondly, and then, with the dread apprehension</p>
<p>Always haunting the slave, fell her eye on the face of the gambler,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Dark and lustful and fierce and full of merciless cunning.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>Something was spoken so low that I could not hear what the words were;</p>
<p>Only the woman started, and looked from one to the other,</p>
<p>With imploring eyes, bewildered hands, and a tremor</p>
<p>All through her frame: I saw her from where I was standing, she shook so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say! is it so?&rsquo; she cried. On the weak, white lips of her master</p>
<p>Died a sickly smile, and he said, &lsquo;Louise, I have sold you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>God is my judge! May I never see such a look of despairing,</p>
<p>Desolate anguish, as that which the woman cast on her master,</p>
<p>Griping her breast with her little hands, as if he had stabbed her,</p>
<p>Standing in silence a space, as fixed as the Indian woman</p>
<p>Carved out of wood, on the pilot-house of the old Pocahontas!</p>
<p>Then, with a gurgling moan, like the sound in the throat of the dying,</p>
<p>Came back her voice, that, rising, fluttered, through wild incoherence,</p>
<p>Into a terrible shriek that stopped my heart while she answered:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Sold me? sold me? sold&ndash;&ndash;And you promised to give me my freedom!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Promised me, for the sake of our little boy in Saint Louis!</p>
<p>What will you say to our boy, when he cries for me there in Saint Louis?</p>
<p>What will you say to our God?&ndash;&ndash;Ah, you have been joking! I see it!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>No? God! God! He shall hear it,&ndash;&ndash;and all of the angels in heaven,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Even the devils in hell!&ndash;&ndash;and none will believe when they hear it!</p>
<p>Sold me!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;Her voice died away with a wail, and in silence</p>
<p>Down she sank on the deck, and covered her face with her fingers.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>IV.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>In his story a moment the pilot paused, while we listened</p>
<p>To the salute of a boat, that, rounding the point of an island,</p>
<p>Flamed toward us with fires that seemed to burn from the waters,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Stately and vast and swift, and borne on the heart of the current.</p>
<p>Then, with the mighty voice of a giant challenged to battle,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>Rose the responsive whistle, and all the echoes of island,</p>
<p>Swamp-land, glade, and brake replied with a myriad clamor,</p>
<p>Like wild birds that are suddenly startled from slumber at midnight,</p>
<p>Then were at peace once more; and we heard the harsh cries of the peacocks</p>
<p>Perched on a tree by a cabin-door, where the white-headed settler&rsquo;s</p>
<p>White-headed children stood to look at the boat as it passed them,</p>
<p>Passed them so near that we heard their happy talk and their laughter.</p>
<p>Softly the sunset had faded, and now on the eastern horizon</p>
<p>Hung, like a tear in the sky, the beautiful star of the evening.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>V.</p>

<p>Here, you! rise at once, and be ready now to go with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roughly he seized the woman&rsquo;s arm and strove to uplift her.</p>
<p>She&ndash;&ndash;she seemed not to heed him, but rose like one that is dreaming,</p>
<p>Slid from his grasp, and fleetly mounted the steps of the gangway,</p>
<p>Up to the hurricane-deck, in silence, without lamentation.</p>
<p>Straight to the stern of the boat, where the wheel was, she ran, and the people</p>
<p>Followed her fast till she turned and stood at bay for a moment,</p>
<p>Looking them in the face, and in the face of the gambler.</p>
<p>Not one to save her,&ndash;&ndash;not one of all the compassionate people!</p>
<p>Not one to save her, of all the pitying angels in heaven!</p>
<p>Not one bolt of God to strike him dead there before her!</p>
<p>Wildly she waved him back, we waiting in silence and horror.</p>
<p>Over the swarthy face of the gambler a pallor of passion</p>
<p>Passed, like a gleam of lightning over the west in the night-time.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>White, she stood, and mute, till he put forth his hand to secure her;</p>
<p>Then she turned and leaped,&ndash;&ndash;in mid-air fluttered a moment,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Down then, whirling, fell, like a broken-winged bird from a tree-top,</p>
<p>Down on the cruel wheel, that caught her, and hurled her, and crushed her,</p>
<p>And in the foaming water plunged her, and hid her forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still with his back to us all the pilot stood, but we heard him</p>
<p>Swallowing hard, as he pulled the bell-rope for stopping. Then, turning,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place where it happened,&rdquo; brokenly whispered the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I never like to go by here alone in the night-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkly the Mississippi flowed by the town that lay in the starlight,</p>
<p>Cheerful with lamps. Below we could hear them reversing the engines,</p>
<p>And the great boat glided up to the shore like a giant exhausted.</p>
<p>Heavily sighed her pipes. Broad over the swamps to the eastward</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>Shone the full moon, and turned our far-trembling wake into silver.</p>
<p>All was serene and calm, but the odorous breath of the willows</p>
<p>Smote with a mystical sense of infinite sorrow upon us.</p>

<h2>LOUIS LEBEAU&rsquo;S CONVERSION.</h2>

<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Yesterday, while I moved with the languid crowd on the Riva,</p>
<p>Musing with idle eyes on the wide lagoons and the islands,</p>
<p>And on the dim-seen seaward glimmering sails in the distance,</p>
<p>Where the azure haze, like a vision of Indian-Summer,</p>
<p>Haunted the dreamy sky of the soft Venetian December,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>While I moved unwilled in the mellow warmth of the weather,</p>
<p>Breathing air that was full of Old World sadness and beauty</p>
<p>Into my thought came this story of free, wild life in Ohio,</p>
<p>When the land was new, and yet by the Beautiful River</p>
<p>Dwelt the pioneers and Indian hunters and boatmen.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Pealed from the campanili, responding from island to island,</p>
<p>Bells of that ancient faith whose incense and solemn devotions</p>
<p>Rise from a hundred shrines in the broken heart of the city;</p>
<p>But in my revery heard I only the passionate voices</p>
<p>Of the people that sang in the virgin heart of the forest.</p>
<p>Autumn was in the land, and the trees were golden and crimson,</p>
<p>And from the luminous boughs of the over-elms and the maples</p>
<p>Tender and beautiful fell the light in the worshippers&rsquo; faces,</p>
<p>Softer than lights that stream through the saints on the windows of churches,</p>
<p>While the balsamy breath of the hemlocks and pines by the river</p>
<p>Stole on the winds through the woodland aisles like the breath of a censer.</p>
<p>Loud the people sang old camp-meeting anthems that quaver</p>
<p>Quaintly yet from lips forgetful of lips that have kissed them;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>Loud they sang the songs of the Sacrifice and Atonement,</p>
<p>And of the end of the world, and the infinite terrors of Judgment:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Songs of ineffable sorrow, and wailing, compassionate warning</p>
<p>Unto the generations that hardened their hearts to their Savior;</p>
<p>Songs of exultant rapture for them that confessed him and followed,</p>
<p>Bearing his burden and yoke, enduring and entering with him</p>
<p>Into the rest of his saints, and the endless reward of the blessed.</p>
<p>Loud the people sang; but through the sound of their singing</p>
<p>Broke inarticulate cries and moans and sobs from the mourners,</p>
<p>As the glory of God, that smote the apostle of Tarsus,</p>
<p>Smote them and strewed them to earth like leaves in the breath of the whirlwind.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Hushed at last was the sound of the lamentation and singing;</p>
<p>But from the distant hill the throbbing drum of the pheasant</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>Shook with its heavy pulses the depths of the listening silence,</p>
<p>When from his place arose a white-haired exhorter, and faltered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren and sisters in Jesus! the Lord hath heard our petitions,</p>
<p>So that the hearts of his servants are awed and melted within them,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Even the hearts of the wicked are touched by his infinite mercy.</p>
<p>All my days in this vale of tears the Lord hath been with me,</p>
<p>He hath been good to me, he hath granted me trials and patience;</p>
<p>But this hour hath crowned my knowledge of him and his goodness.</p>
<p>Truly, but that it is well this day for me to be with you,</p>
<p>Now might I say to the Lord,&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;I know thee, my God, in all fulness;</p>
<p>Now let thy servant depart in peace to the rest thou hast promised!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Faltered and ceased. And now the wild and jubilant music</p>
<p>Of the singing burst from the solemn profound of the silence,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Surged in triumph, and fell, and ebbed again into silence.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Then from the group of the preachers arose the greatest among them,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He whose days were given in youth to the praise of the Savior,</p>
<p>He whose lips seemed touched, like the prophet&rsquo;s of old, from the altar,</p>
<p>So that his words were flame, and burned to the hearts of his hearers,</p>
<p>Quickening the dead among them, reviving the cold and the doubting.</p>
<p>There he charged them pray, and rest not from prayer while a sinner</p>
<p>In the sound of their voices denied the Friend of the sinner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray till the night shall fall,&ndash;&ndash;till the stars are faint in the morning,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Yea, till the sun himself be faint in that glory and brightness,</p>
<p>Faint in the light which shall dawn in mercy for penitent sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kneeling, he led them in prayer; and the quick and sobbing responses</p>
<p>Spake how their souls were moved with the might and the grace of the Spirit.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>Then while the converts recounted how God had chastened and saved them,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Children, whose golden locks yet shone with the lingering effulgence</p>
<p>Of the touches of Him who blessed little children forever;</p>
<p>Old men, whose yearning eyes were dimmed with the far-streaming brightness</p>
<p>Seen through the opening gates in the heart of the heavenly city,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Stealthily through the harking woods the lengthening shadows</p>
<p>Chased the wild things to their nests, and the twilight died into darkness.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Now the four great pyres that were placed there to light the encampment,</p>
<p>High on platforms raised above the people, were kindled.</p>
<p>Flaming aloof, as it were the pillar by night in the Desert</p>
<p>Fell their crimson light on the lifted orbs of the preachers,</p>
<p>Fell on the withered brows of the old men, and Israel&rsquo;s mothers,</p>
<p>Fell on the bloom of youth, and the earnest devotion of manhood,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Fell on the anguish and hope in the tearful eyes of the mourners.</p>
<p>Flaming aloof, it stirred the sleep of the luminous maples</p>
<p>With warm summer-dreams, and faint, luxurious languor.</p>
<p>Near the four great pyres the people closed in a circle,</p>
<p>In their midst the mourners, and, praying with them, the exhorters,</p>
<p>And on the skirts of the circle the unrepentant and scorners,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Ever fewer and sadder, and drawn to the place of the mourners,</p>
<p>One after one, by the prayers and tears of the brethren and sisters,</p>
<p>And by the Spirit of God, that was mightily striving within them,</p>
<p>Till at the last alone stood Louis Lebeau, unconverted.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Louis Lebeau, the boatman, the trapper, the hunter, the fighter,</p>
<p>From the unlucky French of Gallipolis he descended,</p>
<p>Heir to Old World want and New World love of adventure.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Vague was the life he led, and vague and grotesque were the rumors</p>
<p>Through which he loomed on the people,&ndash;&ndash;the hero of mythical hearsay,</p>
<p>Quick of hand and of heart, impatient, generous, Western,</p>
<p>Taking the thought of the young in secret love and in envy.</p>
<p>Not less the elders shook their heads and held him for outcast,</p>
<p>Reprobate, roving, ungodly, infidel, worse than a Papist,</p>
<p>With his whispered fame of lawless exploits at St. Louis,</p>
<p>Wild affrays and loves with the half-breeds out on the Osage,</p>
<p>Brawls at New Orleans, and all the towns on the rivers,</p>
<p>All the godless towns of the many-ruffianed rivers.</p>
<p>Only she who loved him the best of all, in her loving</p>
<p>Knew him the best of all, and other than that of the rumors.</p>
<p>Daily she prayed for him, with conscious and tender effusion,</p>
<p>That the Lord would convert him. But when her father forbade him</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>Unto her thought, she denied him, and likewise held him for outcast,</p>
<p>Turned her eyes when they met, and would not speak, though her heart broke.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Bitter and brief his logic that reasoned from wrong unto error:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is their praying and singing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that makes you reject me,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>You that were kind to me once. But I think my fathers&rsquo; religion,</p>
<p>With a light heart in the breast and a friendly priest to absolve one,</p>
<p>Better than all these conversions that only bewilder and vex me,</p>
<p>And that have made men so hard and women fickle and cruel.</p>
<p>Well, then, pray for my soul, since you would not have spoken to save me,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Yes; for I go from these saints to my brethren and sisters, the sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spoke and went, while her faint lips fashioned unuttered entreaties,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Went, and came again in a year at the time of the meeting,</p>
<p>Haggard and wan of face, and wasted with passion and sorrow.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Dead in his eyes was the careless smile of old, and its phantom</p>
<p>Haunted his lips in a sneer of restless, incredulous mocking.</p>
<p>Day by day he came to the outer skirts of the circle,</p>
<p>Dwelling on her, where she knelt by the white-haired exhorter, her father,</p>
<p>With his hollow looks, and never moved from his silence.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Now, where he stood alone, the last of impenitent sinners,</p>
<p>Weeping, old friends and comrades came to him out of the circle,</p>
<p>And with their tears besought him to hear what the Lord had done for them.</p>
<p>Ever he shook them off, not roughly, nor smiled at their transports.</p>
<p>Then the preachers spoke and painted the terrors of Judgment,</p>
<p>And of the bottomless pit, and the flames of hell everlasting.</p>
<p>Still and dark he stood, and neither listened nor heeded;</p>
<p>But when the fervent voice of the white-haired exhorter was lifted,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Fell his brows in a scowl of fierce and scornful rejection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, let this soul be saved!&rdquo; cried the fervent voice of the old man;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that the Shepherd rejoiceth more truly for one that hath wandered,</p>
<p>And hath been found again, than for all the others that strayed not.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Out of the midst of the people, a woman old and decrepit,</p>
<p>Tremulous through the light, and tremulous into the shadow,</p>
<p>Wavered toward him with slow, uncertain paces of palsy,</p>
<p>Laid her quivering hand on his arm and brokenly prayed him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louis Lebeau, I closed in death the eyes of your mother.</p>
<p>On my breast she died, in prayer for her fatherless children,</p>
<p>That they might know the Lord, and follow him always, and serve him.</p>
<p>O, I conjure you, my son, by the name of your mother in glory,</p>
<p>Scorn not the grace of the Lord!&rdquo; As when a summer-noon&rsquo;s tempest</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>Breaks in one swift gush of rain, then ceases and gathers</p>
<p>Darker and gloomier yet on the lowering front of the heavens,</p>
<p>So broke his mood in tears, as he soothed her, and stilled her entreaties,</p>
<p>And so he turned again with his clouded looks to the people.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Vibrated then from the hush the accents of mournfullest pity,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>His who was gifted in speech, and the glow of the fires illumined</p>
<p>All his pallid aspect with sudden and marvellous splendor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louis Lebeau,&rdquo; he spake, &ldquo;I have known you and loved you from childhood;</p>
<p>Still, when the others blamed you, I took your part, for I knew you.</p>
<p>Louis Lebeau, my brother, I thought to meet you in heaven,</p>
<p>Hand in hand with her who is gone to heaven before us,</p>
<p>Brothers through her dear love! I trusted to greet you and lead you</p>
<p>Up from the brink of the River unto the gates of the City.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Lo! my years shall be few on the earth. O my brother,</p>
<p>If I should die before you had known the mercy of Jesus,</p>
<p>Yea, I think it would sadden the hope of glory within me!&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Neither yet had the will of the sinner yielded an answer;</p>
<p>But from his lips there broke a cry of unspeakable anguish,</p>
<p>Wild and fierce and shrill, as if some demon within him</p>
<p>Bent his soul with the ultimate pangs of fiendish possession;</p>
<p>And with the outstretched arms of bewildered imploring toward them,</p>
<p>Death-white unto the people he turned his face from the darkness.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Out of the sedge by the creek a flight of clamorous killdees</p>
<p>Rose from their timorous sleep with piercing and iterant challenge,</p>
<p>Wheeled in the starlight, and fled away into distance and silence.</p>
<p>White in the vale lay the tents, and beyond them glided the river,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>Where the broadhorn<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> drifted slow at the will of the current,</p>
<p>And where the boatman listened, and knew not how, as he listened,</p>
<p>Something touched through the years the old lost hopes of his childhood,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Only his sense was filled with low, monotonous murmurs,</p>
<p>As of a faint-heard prayer, that was chorused with deeper responses.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Not with the rest was lifted her voice in the fervent responses,</p>
<p>But in her soul she prayed to Him that heareth in secret,</p>
<p>Asking for light and for strength to learn his will and to do it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, make me clear to know if the hope that rises within me</p>
<p>Be not part of a love unmeet for me here, and forbidden!</p>
<p>So, if it be not that, make me strong for the evil entreaty</p>
<p>Of the days that shall bring me question of self and reproaches,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>When the unrighteous shall mock, and my brethren and sisters shall doubt me!</p>
<p>Make me worthy to know thy will, my Savior, and do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her pain she prayed, and at last, through her mute adoration,</p>
<p>Rapt from all mortal presence, and in her rapture uplifted,</p>
<p>Glorified she rose, and stood in the midst of the people,</p>
<p>Looking on all with the still, unseeing eyes of devotion,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Vague, and tender, and sweet, as the eyes of the dead, when we dream them</p>
<p>Living and looking on us, but they cannot speak, and we cannot,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Knowing only the peril that threatened his soul&rsquo;s unrepentance,</p>
<p>Knowing only the fear and error and wrong that withheld him,</p>
<p>Thinking, &ldquo;In doubt of me, his soul had perished forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touched with no feeble shame, but trusting her power to save him,</p>
<p>Through the circle she passed, and straight to the side of her lover,</p>
<p>Took his hand in her own, and mutely implored him an instant,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Answering, giving, forgiving, confessing, beseeching him all things;</p>
<p>Drew him then with her, and passed once more through the circle</p>
<p>Unto her place, and knelt with him there by the side of her father,</p>
<p>Trembling as women tremble who greatly venture and triumph,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But in her innocent breast was the saint&rsquo;s sublime exultation.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>So was Louis converted; and though the lips of the scorners</p>
<p>Spared not in after years the subtle taunt and derision</p>
<p>(What time, meeker grown, his heart held his hand from its answer),</p>
<p>Not the less lofty and pure her love and her faith that had saved him,</p>
<p>Not the less now discerned was her inspiration from heaven</p>
<p>By the people, that rose, and embracing and weeping together,</p>
<p>Poured forth their jubilant songs of victory and of thanksgiving,</p>
<p>Till from the embers leaped the dying flame to behold them,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>And the hills of the river were filled with reverberant echoes,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Echoes that out of the years and the distance stole to me hither,</p>
<p>While I moved unwilled in the mellow warmth of the weather;</p>
<p>Echoes that mingled and fainted and fell with the fluttering murmurs</p>
<p>In the hearts of the hushing bells, as from island to island</p>
<p>Swooned the sound on the wide lagoons into palpitant silence.</p>

<p>I know they won the faint perfume,</p>
<p class='indent2'>That to their faded pages clings,</p>
<p class='indent2'>From gloves, and handkerchiefs, and things</p>
<p>Kept in the soft and scented gloom</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Of some mysterious box&ndash;&ndash;poor leaves</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of summer, now as sere and dead</p>
<p class='indent2'>As any leaves of summer shed</p>
<p>From crimson boughs when autumn grieves!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>The ghost of fragrance! Yet I thrill</p>
<p class='indent2'>All through with such delicious pain</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of soul and sense, to breathe again</p>
<p>The sweet that haunted memory still.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And under these December skies,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As bland as May&rsquo;s in other climes,</p>
<p class='indent2'>I move, and muse my idle rhymes</p>
<p>And subtly sentimentalize.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>I hear the music that was played,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>The songs that silence knows by heart!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>I see sweet burlesque feigning art,</p>
<p>The careless grace that curved and swayed</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Through dances and through breezy walks;</p>
<p class='indent2'>I feel once more the eyes that smiled,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And that dear presence that beguiled</p>
<p>The pauses of the foolish talks,</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>When this poor phantom of perfume</p>
<p class='indent2'>Was the Sweet Clover&rsquo;s living soul,</p>

<p>We have not many ways with pain:</p>
<p class='indent2'>We weep weak tears, or else we laugh;</p>
<p class='indent2'>I doubt, not less the cup we quaff,</p>
<p>And tears and scorn alike are vain.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>But let me live my quiet life;</p>
<p class='indent2'>I will not vex my calm with grief,</p>
<p class='indent2'>I only know the pang was brief,</p>
<p>And there an end of hope and strife.</p>

<p>And thou? I put the letters by:</p>
<p class='indent2'>In years the sweetness shall not pass;</p>
<p class='indent2'>More than the perfect blossom was</p>
<p>I count its lingering memory.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Alas! with Time dear Love is dead,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And not with Fate. And who can guess</p>
<p class='indent2'>How weary of our happiness</p>
<p>We might have been if we were wed?</p>

<p>Confronting each other the pictures stare</p>
<p class='indent2'>Into each other&rsquo;s sleepless eyes;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And the daylight into the darkness dies,</p>
<p>From year to year in the palace there:</p>
<p class='indent2'>But they watch and guard that no device</p>
<p>Take either one of them unaware.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Their majesties the king and the queen,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The parents of the reigning prince:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Both put off royalty many years since,</p>
<p>With life and the gifts that have always been</p>
<p class='indent2'>Given to kings from God, to evince</p>
<p>His sense of the mighty over the mean.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I cannot say that I like the face</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of the king; it is something fat and red;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And the neck that lifts the royal head</p>
<p>Is thick and coarse; and a scanty grace</p>
<p class='indent2'>Dwells in the dull blue eyes that are laid</p>
<p>Sullenly on the queen in her place.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p>He must have been a king in his day</p>
<p class='indent2'>&rsquo;Twere well to pleasure in work and sport:</p>
<p class='indent2'>One of the heaven-anointed sort</p>
<p>Who ruled his people with iron sway,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And knew that, through good and evil report,</p>
<p>God meant him to rule and them to obey.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>There are many other likenesses</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of the king in his royal palace there;</p>
<p class='indent2'>You find him depicted everywhere,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>In his robes of state, in his hunting-dress,</p>
<p class='indent2'>In his flowing wig, in his powdered hair,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A king in all of them, none the less;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>But most himself in this on the wall</p>
<p class='indent2'>Over against his consort, whose</p>
<p class='indent2'>Laces, and hoops, and high-heeled shoes</p>
<p>Make her the finest lady of all</p>
<p class='indent2'>The queens or courtly dames you choose,</p>
<p>In the ancestral portrait hall.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>A glorious blonde: a luxury</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of luring blue and wanton gold,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of blanch&eacute;d rose and crimson bold,</p>
<p>Of lines that flow voluptuously</p>
<p class='indent2'>In tender, languorous curves to fold</p>
<p>Her form in perfect symmetry.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>She might have been false. Of her withered dust</p>
<p class='indent2'>There scarcely would be enough to write</p>
<p class='indent2'>Her guilt in now; and the dead have a right</p>
<p>To our lenient doubt if not to our trust:</p>
<p class='indent2'>So if the truth cannot make her white,</p>
<p>Let us be as merciful as we&ndash;&ndash;must.</p>

<p>The queen died first, the queen died young,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But the king was very old when he died,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Rotten with license, and lust, and pride;</p>
<p>And the usual Virtues came and hung</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their cypress wreaths on his tomb, and wide</p>
<p>Throughout his kingdom his praise was sung.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>How the queen died is not certainly known,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And faithful subjects are all forbid</p>
<p class='indent2'>To speak of the murder which some one did</p>
<p>One night while she slept in the dark alone:</p>
<p class='indent2'>History keeps the story hid,</p>
<p>And Fear only tells it in undertone.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Up from your startled feet aloof,</p>
<p class='indent2'>In the famous Echo-Room, with a bound</p>
<p class='indent2'>Leaps the echo, and round and round</p>
<p>Beating itself against the roof,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>A horrible, gasping, shuddering sound,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Dies ere its terror can utter proof</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Of that it knows. A door is fast,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And none is suffered to enter there.</p>
<p class='indent2'>His sacred majesty could not bear</p>
<p>To look at it toward the last,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As he grew very old. It opened where</p>
<p>The queen died young so many years past.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>How the queen died is not certainly known;</p>
<p class='indent2'>But in the palace&rsquo;s solitude</p>
<p class='indent2'>A harking dread and horror brood,</p>
<p>And a silence, as if a mortal groan</p>
<p class='indent2'>Had been hushed the moment before, and would</p>
<p>Break forth again when you were gone.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>The present king has never dwelt</p>
<p class='indent2'>In the desolate palace. From year to year</p>
<p class='indent2'>In the wide and stately garden drear</p>
<p>The snows and the snowy blossoms melt</p>
<p class='indent2'>Unheeded, and a ghastly fear</p>
<p>Through all the shivering leaves is felt.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>By night the gathering shadows creep</p>
<p class='indent2'>Along the dusk and hollow halls,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And the slumber-broken palace calls</p>
<p>With stifled moans from its nightmare sleep;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And then the ghostly moonlight falls</p>
<p>Athwart the darkness brown and deep.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>At early dawn the light wind sighs,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And through the desert garden blows</p>
<p class='indent2'>The wasted sweetness of the rose;</p>
<p>At noon the feverish sunshine lies</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sick in the walks. But at evening&rsquo;s close,</p>
<p>When the last, long rays to the windows rise,</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And with many a blood-red, wrathful streak</p>
<p class='indent2'>Pierce through the twilight glooms that blur</p>
<p class='indent2'>His cruel vigilance and her</p>
<p>Regard, they light fierce looks that wreak</p>
<p class='indent2'>A hopeless hate that cannot stir,</p>
<p>A voiceless hate that cannot speak</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>In the awful calm of the sleepless eyes;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And as if she saw her murderer glare</p>
<p class='indent2'>On her face, and he the white despair</p>
<p>Of his victim kindle in wild surmise,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Confronted the conscious pictures stare,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And their secret back into darkness dies.</p>

<p>The author of this ballad has added a thread of evident
love-story to a most romantic incident of the history of Mantua,
which occurred in the fifteenth century. He relates the incident
so nearly as he found it in the <i>Cronache Montovane</i>, that
he is ashamed to say how little his invention has been employed
in it. The hero of the story, Federigo, became the third Marquis
of Mantua, and was a prince greatly beloved and honored
by his subjects.</p>

<p>But the wind of autumn breathes from the orchards at nightfall,</p>
<p>Full of winy perfume and mystical yearning and languor;</p>
<p>And in the noonday woods you hear the foraging squirrels,</p>
<p>And the long, crashing fall of the half-eaten nut from the tree-top;</p>
<p>When the robins are mute, and the yellow-birds, haunting the thistles,</p>
<p>Cheep, and twitter, and flit through the dusty lanes and the loppings,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>When the pheasant booms from your stealthy foot in the cornfield,</p>
<p>And the wild-pigeons feed, few and shy, in the scoke-berry bushes;</p>
<p>When the weary land lies hushed, like a seer in a vision,</p>
<p>And your life seems but the dream of a dream which you cannot remember,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Broken, bewildering, vague, an echo that answers to nothing!</p>
<p>That time of year, you know. They stood by the gate in the meadow,</p>
<p>Fronting the sinking sun, and the level stream of its splendor</p>
<p>Crimsoned the meadow-slope and woodland with tenderest sunset,</p>
<p>Made her beautiful face like the luminous face of an angel,</p>
<p>Smote through the pain&eacute;d gloom of his heart like a hurt to the sense, there.</p>
<p>Languidly clung about by the half-fallen shawl, and with folded</p>
<p>Hands, that held a few sad asters: &ldquo;I sigh for this idyl</p>
<p>Lived at last to an end; and, looking on to my prose-life,&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, she said, and a subtle derision of manner,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Better and better I seem, when I recollect all that has happened</p>
<p>Since I came here in June: the walks we have taken together</p>
<p>Through these darling meadows, and dear, old, desolate woodlands;</p>
<p>All our afternoon readings, and all our strolls through the moonlit</p>
<p>Village,&ndash;&ndash;so sweetly asleep, one scarcely could credit the scandal,</p>
<p>Heartache, and trouble, and spite, that were hushed for the night, in its silence.</p>
<p>Yes, I am better. I think I could even be civil to <i>him</i> for his kindness,</p>
<p>Letting me come here without him.... But open the gate, Cousin Clement;</p>
<p>Seems to me it grows chill, and I think it is healthier in-doors.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;No, then I you need not speak, for I know well enough what is coming:</p>
<p>Bitter taunts for the past, and discouraging views of the future?</p>
<p>Tragedy, Cousin Clement, or comedy,&ndash;&ndash;just as you like it;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Only not here alone, but somewhere that people can see you.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll take part in the play, and appear the remorseful young person</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Full of divine regrets at not having smothered a genius</p>
<p>Under the feathers and silks of a foolish, extravagant woman.</p>
<p>O you selfish boy! what was it, just now, about anguish?</p>
<p>Bills would be your talk, Cousin Clement, if you were my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Then, with her summer-night glory of eyes low-bending upon him,</p>
<p>Dark&rsquo;ning his thoughts as the pondered stars bewilder and darken,</p>
<p>Tenderly, wistfully drooping toward him, she faltered in whisper,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>All her mocking face transfigured,&ndash;&ndash;with mournful effusion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clement, do not think it is you alone that remember,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Do not think it is you alone that have suffered. Ambition,</p>
<p>Fame, and your art,&ndash;&ndash;you have all these things to console you.</p>
<p>I&ndash;&ndash;what have I in this world? Since my child is dead&ndash;&ndash;a bereavement.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sad hung her eyes on his, and he felt all the anger within him</p>
<p>Broken, and melting in tears. But he shrank from her touch while he answered</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>(Awkwardly, being a man, and awkwardly, being a lover),</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you know how it is done. You have cleverly fooled me beforetime,</p>
<p>With a dainty scorn, and then an imploring forgiveness!</p>
<p>Yes, you might play it, I think,&ndash;&ndash;that <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of remorseful young person,</p>
<p>That, or the old man&rsquo;s darling, or anything else you attempted.</p>
<p>Even your earnest is so much like acting I fear a betrayal,</p>
<p>Trusting your speech. You say that you have not forgotten. I grant you&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Not, indeed, for your word&ndash;&ndash;that is light&ndash;&ndash;but I wish to believe you.</p>
<p>Well, I say, since you have not forgotten, forget now, forever!</p>
<p>I&ndash;&ndash;I have lived and loved, and you have lived and have married.</p>
<p>Only receive this bud to remember me when we have parted,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Thorns and splendor, no sweetness, rose of the love that I cherished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There he tore from its stalk the imperial flower of the thistle,</p>
<p>Tore, and gave to her, who took it with mocking obeisance,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Twined it in her hair, and said, with her subtle derision:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a wiser man than I thought you could ever be, Clement,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Sensible, almost. So! I&rsquo;ll try to forget and remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lightly she took his arm, but on through the lane to the farm-house,</p>
<p>Mutely together they moved through the lonesome, odorous twilight.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>II.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>High on the farm-house hearth, the first autumn fire was kindled;</p>
<p>Scintillant hickory bark and dryest limbs of the beech-tree</p>
<p>Burned, where all summer long the boughs of asparagus flourished.</p>
<p>Wild were the children with mirth, and grouping and clinging together,</p>
<p>Danced with the dancing flame, and lithely swayed with its humor;</p>
<p>Ran to the window-panes, and peering forth into the darkness,</p>
<p>Saw there another room, flame-lit, and with frolicking children.</p>
<p>(Ah! by such phantom hearths, I think that we sit with our first-loves!)</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>Sometimes they tossed on the floor, and sometimes they hid in the corners,</p>
<p>Shouting and laughing aloud, and never resting a moment,</p>
<p>In the rude delight, the boisterous gladness of childhood,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Cruel as summer sun and singing-birds to the heartsick.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Clement sat in his chair unmoved in the midst of the hubbub,</p>
<p>Rapt, with unseeing eyes; and unafraid in their gambols,</p>
<p>By his tawny beard the children caught him, and clambered</p>
<p>Over his knees, and waged a mimic warfare across them,</p>
<p>Made him their battle-ground, and won and lost kingdoms upon him.</p>
<p>Airily to and fro, and out of one room to another</p>
<p>Passed his cousin, and busied herself with things of the household,</p>
<p>Nonchalant, debonair, blithe, with bewitching housewifely importance,</p>
<p>Laying the cloth for the supper, and bringing the meal from the kitchen;</p>
<p>Fairer than ever she seemed, and more than ever she mocked him,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>Coming behind his chair, and clasping her fingers together</p>
<p>Over his eyes in a girlish caprice, and crying, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vexed his despair with a vision of wife and of home and of children,</p>
<p>Calling his sister&rsquo;s children around her, and stilling their clamor,</p>
<p>Making believe they were hers. And Clement sat moody and silent,</p>
<p>Blank to the wistful gaze of his mother bent on his visage</p>
<p>With the tender pain, the pitiful, helpless devotion</p>
<p>Of the mother that looks on the face of her son in his trouble,</p>
<p>Grown beyond her consoling, and knows that she cannot befriend him.</p>
<p>Then his cousin laughed, and in idleness talked with the children;</p>
<p>Sometimes she turned to him, and then when the thistle was falling,</p>
<p>Caught it and twined it again in her hair, and called it her keepsake,</p>
<p>Smiled, and made him ashamed of his petulant gift there, before them.</p>
<p class='indent2'>But, when the night was grown old and the two by the hearthstone together</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Sat alone in the flickering red of the flame, and the cricket</p>
<p>Carked to the stillness, and ever, with sullen throbs of the pendule</p>
<p>Sighed the time-worn clock for the death of the days that were perished,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>It was her whim to be sad, and she brought him the book they were reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it to-night,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I may not seem to be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, and mutely reproached him with all the pain she had wrought him.</p>
<p>From her hand he took the volume and read, and she listened,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>All his voice molten in secret tears, and ebbing and flowing,</p>
<p>Now with a faltering breath, and now with impassioned abandon,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Read from the book of a poet the rhyme of the fatally sundered,</p>
<p>Fatally met too late, and their love was their guilt and their anguish,</p>
<p>But in the night they rose, and fled away into the darkness,</p>
<p>Glad of all dangers and shames, and even of death, for their love&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Then, when his voice brake hollowly, falling and fading to silence,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>Thrilled in the silence they sat, and durst not behold one another,</p>
<p>Feeling that wild temptation, that tender, ineffable yearning,</p>
<p>Drawing them heart to heart. One blind, mad moment of passion</p>
<p>With their fate they strove; but out of the pang of the conflict,</p>
<p>Through such costly triumph as wins a waste and a famine,</p>
<p>Victors they came, and Love retrieved the error of loving.</p>
<p class='indent2'>So, foreknowing the years, and sharply discerning the future,</p>
<p>Guessing the riddle of life, and accepting the cruel solution,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Side by side they sat, as far as the stars are asunder.</p>
<p>Carked the cricket no more, but while the audible silence</p>
<p>Shrilled in their ears, she, suddenly rising and dragging the thistle</p>
<p>Out of her clinging hair, laughed mockingly, casting it from her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perish the thorns and splendor,&ndash;&ndash;the bloom and the sweetness are perished.</p>
<p>Dreary, respectable calm, polite despair, and one&rsquo;s Duty,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>These and the world, for dead Love!&ndash;&ndash;The end of these modern romances!</p>
<p>Better than yonder rhyme?... Pleasant dreams and good night, Cousin Clement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parting was over at last, and all the good-bys had been spoken.</p>
<p>Up the long hillside road the white-tented wagon moved slowly,</p>
<p>Bearing the mother and children, while onward before them the father</p>
<p>Trudged with his gun on his arm, and the faithful house-dog beside him,</p>
<p>Grave and sedate, as if knowing the sorrowful thoughts of his master.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>April was in her prime, and the day in its dewy awaking:</p>
<p>Like a great flower, afar on the crest of the eastern woodland,</p>
<p>Goldenly bloomed the sun, and over the beautiful valley,</p>
<p>Dim with its dew and shadow, and bright with its dream of a river,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Looked to the western hills, and shone on the humble procession,</p>
<p>Paining with splendor the children&rsquo;s eyes, and the heart of the mother.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Beauty, and fragrance, and song filled the air like a palpable presence.</p>
<p>Sweet was the smell of the dewy leaves and the flowers in the wild-wood,</p>
<p>Fair the long reaches of sun and shade in the aisles of the forest.</p>
<p>Glad of the spring, and of love, and of morning, the wild birds were singing:</p>
<p>Jays to each other called harshly, then mellowly fluted together;</p>
<p>Sang the oriole songs as golden and gay as his plumage;</p>
<p>Pensively piped the querulous quails their greetings unfrequent,</p>
<p>While, on the meadow elm, the meadow lark gushed forth in music,</p>
<p>Rapt, exultant, and shaken with the great joy of his singing;</p>
<p>Over the river, loud-chattering, aloft in the air, the kingfisher</p>
<p>Hung, ere he dropped, like a bolt, in the water beneath him;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Gossiping, out of the bank flew myriad twittering swallows;</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Never for these things a moment halted the Movers, but onward,</p>
<p>Up the long hillside road the white-tented wagon moved slowly.</p>
<p>Till, on the summit, that overlooked all the beautiful valley,</p>
<p>Trembling and spent, the horses came to a standstill unbidden;</p>
<p>Then from the wagon the mother in silence got down with her children,</p>
<p>Came, and stood by the father, and rested her hand on his shoulder.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Long together they gazed on the beautiful valley before them;</p>

<p>Looked on the pasture-fields where the cattle were lazily grazing,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Soft, and sweet, and thin came the faint, far notes of the cow-bells,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Looked on the oft-trodden lanes, with their elder and blackberry borders,</p>
<p>Looked on the orchard, a bloomy sea, with its billows of blossoms.</p>
<p>Fair was the scene, yet suddenly strange and all unfamiliar,</p>
<p>As are the faces of friends, when the word of farewell has been spoken.</p>
<p>Long together they gazed; then at last on the little log-cabin&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Home for so many years, now home no longer forever&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Rested their tearless eyes in the silent rapture of anguish.</p>
<p>Up on the morning air no column of smoke from the chimney</p>
<p>Wavering, silver and azure, rose, fading and brightening ever;</p>
<p>Shut was the door where yesterday morning the children were playing;</p>
<p>Lit with a gleam of the sun the window stared up at them blindly.</p>
<p>Cold was the hearthstone now, and the place was forsaken and empty.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>Empty? Ah no! but haunted by thronging and tenderest fancies,</p>
<p>Sad recollections of all that had been, of sorrow or gladness.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Still they sat there in the glow of the wide red fire in the winter,</p>
<p>Still they sat there by the door in the cool of the still summer evening,</p>
<p>Still the mother seemed to be singing her babe there to slumber,</p>
<p>Still the father beheld her weep o&rsquo;er the child that was dying,</p>
<p>Still the place was haunted by all the Past&rsquo;s sorrow and gladness!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Neither of them might speak for the thoughts that came crowding their hearts so,</p>
<p>Till, in their ignorant trouble aloud the children lamented;</p>
<p>Then was the spell of silence dissolved, and the father and mother</p>
<p>Burst into tears and embraced, and turned their dim eyes to the Westward.</p>

<p class='indent2'>Grows faint and slumbers in the gray of dawn;</p>
<p>And still she lingers not, but hurries far,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Till in a dreary wilderness withdrawn</p>

<p class='indent2'>Falls down, and cannot either speak or stir:</p>
<p>The hermit comes,&ndash;&ndash;with no white beard before,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Nor coat of skins, nor cap of shaggy fur:</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And then he told her how it chanced that he,</p>
<p class='indent2'>King Cole&rsquo;s son, in that forest held his court,</p>
<p>And the sole reason that there seemed to be</p>
<p class='indent2'>Was, he was being hermit there for sport;</p>
<p class='indent2'>But he confessed the life was not his forte,</p>
<p>And therewith both laughed out right jollily.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XXV.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And sly Bopeep forgot her sheep again</p>
<p class='indent2'>In gay discourse with that engaging youth:</p>

<p>A holy seer,&ndash;&ndash;and through it they did look;</p>

<p class='indent2'>Sometimes their idle eyes together crept,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sometimes their lips; but still the leaves they swept,</p>
<p>Until they found a shepherd&rsquo;s pictured crook.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p class='indent2'>On such a day, in such a month and year,</p>
<p>A maiden fair, a young prince brave and tall,</p>
<p class='indent2'>By such a chance should come together here.</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And thus the hermit&rsquo;s prophecy ran on:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Though she her lost sheep wist not where to find,</p>
<p>Yet should she bid her weary care begone,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And banish every doubt from her sweet mind:</p>

<p>Better than any hermit&rsquo;s prophecies!</p>
<p class='indent2'>They passed together from the cavern&rsquo;s door;</p>

<p>When the regret for my sin was turned to ruthless self-pity&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>When I hated him whose love had made me its victim,</p>

<p>By the fountain whose passionate tears but now had implored me</p>

<p>Everywhere his voice reached my senses in fugitive cadence.</p>
<p>Sick, through the storied cities, with wretched hopes, and upbraidings</p>
<p>Of my own heart for its hopes, I went from wonder to wonder,</p>
<p>Blind to them all, or only beholding them wronged, and related,</p>
<p>Through some trick of wayward thought, to myself and my trouble.</p>
<p>Not surprise nor regret, but a fierce, precipitate gladness</p>
<p>Sent the blood to my throbbing heart when I found him in Venice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting for you,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;you would so.&rdquo; I answered him nothing.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>V.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Father, whose humor grows more silent and ever more absent</p>
<p>(Changed in all but love for me since the death of my mother),</p>
<p>Willing to see me contented at last, and trusting us wholly,</p>
<p>Left us together alone in our world of love and of beauty.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>So, by noon and by night, we two have wandered in Venice,</p>
<p>Where the beautiful lives in vivid and constant caprices,</p>
<p>Yet, where the charm is so perfect that nothing fantastic surprises</p>
<p>More than in dreams, and one&rsquo;s life with the life of the city is blended</p>
<p>In a luxurious calm, and the tumult without and beyond it</p>
<p>Seems but the emptiest fable of vain aspiration and labor.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Yes, from all that makes this Venice sole among cities,</p>
<p>Peerless forever,&ndash;&ndash;the still lagoons that sleep in the sunlight,</p>
<p>Lulled by their island-bells; the night&rsquo;s mysterious waters</p>
<p>Lit through their shadowy depths by stems of splendor, that blossom</p>
<p>Into the lamps that float, like flamy lotuses, over;</p>
<p>Narrow and secret canals, that dimly gleaming and glooming</p>
<p>Under palace-walls and numberless arches of bridges,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>List no sound but the dip of the gondolier&rsquo;s oar and his warning</p>
<p>Cried from corner to corner; the sad, superb Canalazzo</p>
<p>Mirroring marvellous grandeur and beauty, and dreaming of glory</p>
<p>Out of the empty homes of her lords departed; the footways</p>
<p>Wandering sunless between the walls of the houses, and stealing</p>
<p>Glimpses, through rusted cancelli, of lurking greenness of gardens,</p>
<p>Wild-grown flowers and broken statues and mouldering frescos;</p>
<p>Thoroughfares filled with traffic, and throngs ever ebbing and flowing</p>
<p>To and from the heart of the city, whose pride and devotion,</p>
<p>Lifting high the bells of St. Mark&rsquo;s like prayers unto heaven,</p>
<p>Stretch a marble embrace of palaces toward the cathedral</p>
<p>Orient, gorgeous, and flushed with color and light, like the morning!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>From the lingering waste that is not yet ruin in Venice,</p>
<p>And her phantasmal show, through all, of being and doing&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>Came a strange joy to us, untouched by regret for the idle</p>
<p>Days without yesterdays that died into nights without morrows.</p>
<p>Here, in our paradise of love we reigned, new-created,</p>
<p>As in the youth of the world, in the days before evil and conscience.</p>
<p>Ah! in our fair, lost world was neither fearing nor doubting,</p>
<p>Neither the sickness of old remorse nor the gloom of foreboding,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Only the glad surrender of all individual being</p>
<p>Unto him whom I loved, and in whose tender possession,</p>
<p>Fate-free, my soul reposed from its anguish.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent8'>&ndash;&ndash;Of these things I write you</p>
<p>As of another&rsquo;s experience; part of my own they no longer</p>
<p>Seem to me now, through the doom that darkens the past like the future.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>VI.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Golden the sunset gleamed, above the city behind us,</p>
<p>Out of a city of clouds as fairy and lovely as Venice,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>While we looked at the fishing-tails of purple and yellow</p>
<p>Far on the rim of the sea, whose light and musical surges</p>
<p>Broke along the sands with a faint, reiterant sadness.</p>
<p>But, when the sails had darkened into black wings, through the twilight</p>
<p>Sweeping away into night&ndash;&ndash;past the broken tombs of the Hebrews</p>
<p>Homeward we sauntered slowly, through dew-sweet, blossomy alleys;</p>
<p>So drew near the boat by errant and careless approaches,</p>
<p>Entered, and left with indolent pulses the Lido behind us.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>All the sunset had paled, and the campanili of Venice</p>
<p>Rose like the masts of a mighty fleet moored there in the water.</p>
<p>Lights flashed furtively to and fro through the deepening twilight.</p>
<p>Massed in one thick shade lay the Gardens; the numberless islands</p>
<p>Lay like shadows upon the lagoons. And on us as we loitered</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>By their enchanted coasts, a spell of ineffable sweetness</p>
<p>Fell and made us at one with them; and silent and blissful</p>
<p>Shadows we seemed, that drifted on through a being of shadow,</p>
<p>Vague, indistinct to ourselves, unbounded by hope or remembrance.</p>
<p>Yet we knew the beautiful night, as it grew from the evening:</p>
<p>Far beneath us and far above us the vault of the heavens</p>
<p>Glittered and darkened; and now the moon, that had haunted the daylight</p>
<p>Thin and pallid, dimmed the stars with her fulness of splendor,</p>
<p>And over all the lagoons fell the silvery rain of the moonbeams,</p>
<p>As in the song the young girls sang while their gondolas passed us,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Sang in the joy of love, or youth&rsquo;s desire of loving.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Balmy night of the South! O perfect night of the Summer!</p>
<p>Night of the distant dark, of the near and tender effulgence!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>How from my despair are thy peace and loveliness frightened!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>For, while our boat lay there at the will of the light undulations,</p>
<p>Idle as if our mood imbued and controlled it, yet ever</p>
<p>Seeming to bear us on athwart those shining expanses</p>
<p>Out to shining seas beyond pursuit or returning&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>There, while we lingered, and lingered, and would not break from our rapture,</p>
<p>Down the mirrored night another gondola drifted</p>
<p>Nearer and slowly nearer our own, and moonlighted faces</p>
<p>Stared. And that sweet trance grew a rigid and dreadful possession,</p>
<p>Which, if no dream indeed, yet mocked with such semblance of dreaming,</p>
<p>That, as it happens in dreams, when a dear face, stooping to kiss us,</p>
<p>Takes, ere the lips have touched, some malign and horrible aspect,</p>
<p><i>His</i> face faded away, and the face of the Dead&ndash;&ndash;of that other&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Flashed on mine, and writhing, through every change of emotion,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Wild amaze and scorn, accusation and pitiless mocking,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Vanished into the swoon whose blackness encompassed and hid me.</p>

<p>Now your promises back, and hold myself nothing above you,</p>
<p>That it is mine to offer a freedom you never could ask for.</p>
<p>Yet, believe me, indeed, from no bitter heart I release you:</p>
<p>You are as free of me now as though I had died in the battle,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Well, you have solved me the doubt. I dare to trust that you wept me,</p>

<p>I would scarce like to believe that my loss had merely relieved you.</p>

<p>That I had won some right to the palm with the pang of the martyr,&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p class='indent2'>Yes, I promised to write, but how shall I write to you, darling?</p>
<p>Venice we reached last Monday, wild for canals and for color,</p>
<p>Palaces, prisons, lagoons, and gondolas, bravoes, and moonlight,</p>
<p>All the mysterious, dreadful, beautiful things in existence.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>Fred had joined us at Naples, insuff&rsquo;rably knowing and travelled,</p>
<p>Wise in the prices of things and great at tempestuous bargains,</p>
<p>Rich in the costly nothing our youthful travellers buy here,</p>
<p>At a prodigious outlay of time and money and trouble;</p>
<p>Utter confusion of facts, and talking the wildest of pictures,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Pyramids, battle-fields, bills, and examinations of luggage,</p>
<p>Passports, policemen, porters, and how he got through his tobacco,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Ignorant, handsome, full-bearded, brown, and good-natured as ever:</p>
<p>Annie thinks him perfect, and I well enough for a brother.</p>
<p>Also, a friend of Fred&rsquo;s came with us from Naples to Venice;</p>
<p>And, altogether, I think, we are rather agreeable people,</p>
<p>For we&rsquo;ve been taking our pleasure at all times in perfect good-humor;</p>
<p>Which is an excellent thing that you&rsquo;ll understand when you&rsquo;ve travelled,</p>
<p>Seen Recreation dead-beat and cross, and learnt what a burden</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Frescos, for instance, can be, and, in general, what an affliction</p>
<p>Life is apt to become among the antiques and old masters.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Venice we&rsquo;ve thoroughly done, and it&rsquo;s perfectly true of the pictures&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Titians and Tintorettos, and Palmas and Paul Veroneses;</p>
<p>Neither are gondolas fictions, but verities, hearse-like and swan-like,</p>
<p>Quite as the heart could wish. And one finds, to one&rsquo;s infinite comfort,</p>
<p>Venice just as unique as one&rsquo;s fondest visions have made it:</p>
<p>Palaces and mosquitoes rise from the water together,</p>
<p>And, in the city&rsquo;s streets, the salt-sea is ebbing and flowing</p>
<p>Several inches or more.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&ndash;&ndash;Ah! let me not wrong thee, O Venice!</p>
<p>Fairest, forlornest, and saddest of all the cities, and dearest!</p>
<p>Dear, for my heart has won here deep peace from cruel confusion;</p>
<p>And in this lucent air, whose night is but tenderer noon-day,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>Fear is forever dead, and hope has put on the immortal!</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;There! and you need not laugh. I&rsquo;m coming to something directly.</p>
<p>One thing: I&rsquo;ve bought you a chain of the famous fabric of Venice&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Something peculiar and quaint, and of such a delicate texture</p>
<p>That you must wear it embroidered upon a riband of velvet,</p>
<p>If you would have the effect of its exquisite fineness and beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it very frail?&rdquo; I asked of the workman who made it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong enough, if you will, to bind a lover, signora,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>With an expensive smile. &rsquo;Twas bought near the Bridge of Rialto.</p>
<p>(Shylock, you know.) In our shopping, Aunt May and Fred do the talking:</p>
<p>Fred begins always in French, with the most delicious effront&rsquo;ry,</p>
<p>Only to end in profoundest humiliation and English.</p>
<p>Aunt, however, scorns to speak any tongue but Italian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quanto per these ones here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What did you say was the prezzo?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! troppo caro! <i>Too much!</i> No, no! Don&rsquo;t I <i>tell</i> you it&rsquo;s troppo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while insists that the gondolieri shall show us</p>
<p>What she calls Titian&rsquo;s palazzo, and pines for the house of Othello.</p>
<p>Annie, the dear little goose, believes in Fred and her mother</p>
<p>With an enchanting abandon. She doesn&rsquo;t at all understand them,</p>
<p>But she has some twilight views of their cleverness. Father is quiet,</p>
<p>Now and then ventures some French when he fancies that nobody hears him,</p>
<p>In an aside to the valet-de-place&ndash;&ndash;I never detect him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Buys things for mother and me with a quite supernatural sweetness,</p>
<p>Tolerates all Fred&rsquo;s airs, and is indispensably pleasant.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>II.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Prattling on of these things, which I think cannot interest deeply,</p>
<p>So I hold back in my heart its dear and wonderful secret</p>
<p>(Which I must tell you at last, however I falter to tell you),</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>Fain to keep it all my own for a little while longer,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Doubting but it shall lose some part of its strangeness and sweetness,</p>
<p>Shared with another, and fearful that even <i>you</i> may not find it</p>
<p>Just the marvel that I do&ndash;&ndash;and thus turn our friendship to hatred.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Sometimes it seems to me that this love, which I feel is eternal,</p>
<p>Must have begun with my life, and that only an absence was ended</p>
<p>When we met and knew in our souls that we loved one another.</p>
<p>For from the first was no doubt. The earliest hints of the passion,</p>
<p>Whispered to girlhood&rsquo;s tremulous dream, may be mixed with misgiving,</p>
<p>But, when the very love comes, it bears no vagueness of meaning;</p>
<p>Touched by its truth (too fine to be felt by the ignorant senses,</p>
<p>Knowing but looks and utterance) soul unto soul makes confession,</p>
<p>Silence to silence speaks. And I think that this subtile assurance,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>Yet unconfirmed from without, is even sweeter and dearer</p>
<p>Than the perfected bliss that comes when the words have been spoken.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Not that I&rsquo;d have them unsaid, now! But &rsquo;t was delicious to ponder</p>
<p>All the miracle over, and clasp it, and keep it, and hide it,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>While I beheld him, you know, with looks of indifferent languor,</p>
<p>Talking of other things, and felt the divine contradiction</p>
<p>Trouble my heart below!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent8'>And yet, if no doubt touched our passion,</p>
<p>Do not believe for that, our love has been wholly unclouded.</p>
<p>All best things are ours when pain and patience have won them:</p>
<p>Peace itself would mean nothing but for the strife that preceded;</p>
<p>Triumph of love is greatest, when peril of love has been sorest.</p>
<p>(That&rsquo;s to say, I dare say. I&rsquo;m only repeating what <i>he</i> said.)</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>Well, then, of all wretched things in the world, a mystery, Clara,</p>
<p>Lurked in this life dear to mine, and hopelessly held us asunder</p>
<p>When we drew nearest together, and all but his speech said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred had known him at college, and then had found him at Naples,</p>
<p>After several years,&ndash;&ndash;and called him a capital fellow.</p>
<p>Thus far his knowledge went, and beyond this began to run shallow</p>
<p>Over troubled ways, and to break into brilliant conjecture,</p>
<p>Harder by far to endure than the other&rsquo;s reticent absence&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Absence wherein at times he seemed to walk like one troubled</p>
<p>By an uneasy dream, whose spell is not broken with waking,</p>
<p>But it returns all day with a vivid and sudden recurrence,</p>
<p>Like a remembered event. Of the past that was closest the present,</p>
<p>This we knew from himself: He went at the earliest summons,</p>
<p>When the Rebellion began, and falling, terribly wounded,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>Into the enemy&rsquo;s hands, after ages of sickness and prison,</p>
<p>Made his escape at last; and, returning, found all his virtues</p>
<p>Grown out of recognition and shining in posthumous splendor,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Found all changed and estranged, and, he fancied, more wonder than welcome.</p>
<p>So, somewhat heavy of heart, and disabled for war, he had wandered</p>
<p>Hither to Europe for perfecter peace. Abruptly his silence,</p>
<p>Full of suggestion and sadness, made here a chasm between us;</p>
<p>But we spanned the chasm with conversational bridges,</p>
<p>Else talked all around it, and feigned an ignorance of it,</p>
<p>With that absurd pretence which is always so painful, or comic,</p>
<p>Just as you happen to make it or see it.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent14'>In spite of our fictions,</p>
<p>Severed from his by that silence, my heart grew ever more anxious,</p>
<p>Till last night when together we sat in Piazza San Marco</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>(Then, when the morrow must bring us parting&ndash;&ndash;forever, it might be),</p>
<p>Taking our ices al fresco. Some strolling minstrels were singing</p>
<p>Airs from the Trovatore. I noted with painful observance,</p>
<p>With the unwilling minuteness at such times absolute torture,</p>
<p>All that brilliant scene, for which I cared nothing, before me:</p>
<p>Dark-eyed Venetian leoni regarding the forestieri</p>
<p>With those compassionate looks of gentle and curious wonder</p>
<p>Home-keeping Italy&rsquo;s nations bend on the voyaging races,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Taciturn, indolent, sad, as their beautiful city itself is;</p>
<p>Groups of remotest English&ndash;&ndash;not just the traditional English</p>
<p>(Lavish Milor is no more, and your travelling Briton is frugal)&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>English, though, after all, with the Channel always between them,</p>
<p>Islanded in themselves, and the Continent&rsquo;s sociable races;</p>
<p>Country-people of ours&ndash;&ndash;the New World&rsquo;s confident children,</p>
<p>Proud of America always, and even vain of the Troubles</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>As of disaster laid out on a scale unequalled in Europe;</p>
<p>Polyglot Russians that spoke all languages better than natives;</p>
<p>White-coated Austrian officers, anglicized Austrian dandies;</p>
<p>Gorgeous Levantine figures of Greek, and Turk, and Albanian&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>These, and the throngs that moved through the long arcades and Piazza,</p>
<p>Shone on by numberless lamps that flamed round the perfect Piazza,</p>
<p>Jewel-like set in the splendid frame of this beautiful picture,</p>
<p>Full of such motley life, and so altogether Venetian.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Then we rose and walked where the lamps were blanched by the moonlight</p>
<p>Flooding the Piazzetta with splendor, and throwing in shadow</p>
<p>All the fa&ccedil;ade of Saint Mark&rsquo;s, with its pillars, and horses, and arches;</p>
<p>But the sculptured frondage, that blossoms over the arches</p>
<p>Into the forms of saints, was touched with tenderest lucence,</p>
<p>And the angel that stands on the crest of the vast campanile</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>Bathed his golden vans in the liquid light of the moonbeams.</p>
<p>Black rose the granite pillars that lift the Saint and the Lion;</p>
<p>Black sank the island campanili from distance to distance;</p>
<p>Over the charm&egrave;d scene there brooded a presence of music,</p>
<p>Subtler than sound, and felt, unheard, in the depth of the spirit.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>How can I gather and show you the airy threads of enchantment</p>
<p>Woven that night round my life and forever wrought into my being,</p>
<p>As in our boat we glided away from the glittering city?</p>
<p>Dull at heart I felt, and I looked at the lights in the water,</p>
<p>Blurring their brilliance with tears, while the tresses of eddying seaweed,</p>
<p>Whirled in the ebbing tide, like the tresses of sea-maidens drifting</p>
<p>Seaward from palace-haunts, in the moonshine glistened and darkened.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Sad and vague were my thoughts, and full of fear was the silence;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>And, when he turned to speak at last, I trembled to hear him,</p>
<p>Feeling he now must speak of his love, and his life and its secret,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Now that the narrowing chances had left but that cruel conclusion,</p>
<p>Else the life-long ache of a love and a trouble unuttered.</p>
<p>Better, my feebleness pleaded, the dreariest doubt that had vexed me,</p>
<p>Than my life left nothing, not even a doubt to console it;</p>
<p>But, while I trembled and listened, his broken words crumbled to silence,</p>
<p>And, as though some touch of fate had thrilled him with warning,</p>
<p>Suddenly from me he turned. Our gondola slipped from the shadow</p>
<p>Under a ship lying near, and glided into the moonlight,</p>
<p>Where, in its brightest lustre, another gondola rested.</p>
<p><i>I</i> saw two lovers there, and he, in the face of the woman,</p>
<p>Saw what has made him mine, my own belov&egrave;d, forever!</p>
<p>Mine!&ndash;&ndash;but through <i>what</i> tribulation, and awful confusion of spirit!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Tears that I think of with smiles, and sighs I remember with laughter,</p>
<p>Agonies full of absurdity, keen, ridiculous anguish,</p>
<p>Ending in depths of blissful shame, and heavenly transports!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>III.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>White, and estranged as a man who has looked on a spectre, he mutely</p>
<p>Sank to the place at my side, nor while we returned to the city</p>
<p>Uttered a word of explaining, or comment, or comfort, but only,</p>
<p>With his good-night, incoherently craved my forgiveness and patience,</p>
<p>Parted, and left me to spend the night in hysterical vigils,</p>
<p>Tending to Annie&rsquo;s supreme dismay, and postponing our journey</p>
<p>One day longer at least; for I went to bed in the morning,</p>
<p>Firmly rejecting the pity of friends, and the pleasures of travel,</p>
<p>Fixed in a dreadful purpose never to get any better.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Later, however, I rallied, when Fred, with a maddening prologue</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>Touching the cause of my sickness, including his fever at Jaffa,</p>
<p>Told me that some one was waiting; and could he see me a moment?</p>
<p>See me? Certainly not. Or,&ndash;&ndash;yes. But why did he want to?</p>
<p>So, in the dishabille of a morning-gown and an arm-chair,</p>
<p>Languid, with eloquent wanness of eye and of cheek, I received him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Willing to touch and reproach, and half-melted myself by my pathos,</p>
<p>Which, with a reprobate joy, I wholly forgot the next instant,</p>
<p>When, with electric words, few, swift, and vivid, he brought me,</p>
<p>Through a brief tempest of tears, to this heaven of sunshine and sweetness.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Yes, he had looked on a ghost&ndash;&ndash;the phantom of love that was perished!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>When, last night, he beheld the scene of which I have told you.</p>
<p>For to the woman he saw there, his troth had been solemnly plighted</p>
<p>Ere he went to the war. His return from the dead found her absent</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>In the belief of his death; and hither to Europe he followed,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Followed to seek her, and keep, if she would, the promise between them,</p>
<p>Or, were a haunting doubt confirmed, to break it and free her.</p>
<p>Then, at Naples we met, and the love that, before he was conscious,</p>
<p>Turned his life toward mine, laid torturing stress to the purpose</p>
<p>Whither it drove him forever, and whence forever it swerved him.</p>
<p>How could he tell me his love, with this terrible burden upon him?</p>
<p>How could he linger near me, and still withhold the avowal?</p>
<p>And what ruin were that, if the other were doubted unjustly,</p>
<p>And should prove fatally true! With shame, he confessed he had faltered,</p>
<p>Clinging to guilty delays, and to hopes that were bitter with treason,</p>
<p>Up to the eve of our parting. And then the last anguish was spared him.</p>
<p><i>Her</i> love for him was dead. But the heart that leaped in his bosom</p>
<p>With a great, dumb throb of joy and wonder and doubting,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Still must yield to the spell of his silencing will till that phantom</p>
<p>Proved an actual ghost by common-place tests of the daylight,</p>
<p>Such as speech with the lady&rsquo;s father.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent14'>And now, could I pardon&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Nay, did I think I could love him? I sobbingly answered, I thought so.</p>
<p>And we are all of us going to Lago di Como to-morrow,</p>
<p>With an ulterior view at the first convenient Legation.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Patientest darling, good-by! Poor Fred, whose sense of what&rsquo;s proper</p>
<p>Never was touched till now, is shocked at my glad self-betrayals,</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Hard by the Church of Saint Stephen, in sole and beautiful Venice,</p>
<p>Under the colonnade of the Augustinian Convent,</p>
<p>Every day, as I passed, I paused to look at the frescos</p>
<p>Painted upon the ancient walls of the court of the Convent</p>
<p>By a great master of old, who wore his sword and his dagger</p>
<p>While he wrought the figures of patriarchs, martyrs, and virgins</p>
<p>Into the sacred and famous scenes of Scriptural story.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>II.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Long ago the monks from their snug self-devotion were driven,</p>
<p>Wistful and fat and slow: looking backward, I fancied them going</p>
<p>Out through the sculptured doorway, and down the Ponte de&rsquo;Frati,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>Cowled and sandalled and beaded, a plump and pensive procession;</p>
<p>And in my day their cells were barracks for Austrian soldiers,</p>
<p>Who in their turn have followed the Augustinian Friars.</p>
<p>As to the frescos, little remained of work once so perfect.</p>
<p>Summer and winter weather of some three cycles had wasted;</p>
<p>Plaster had fallen, and left unsightly blotches of ruin;</p>
<p>Wanton and stupid neglect had done its worst to the pictures:</p>
<p>Yet to the sympathetic and reverent eye was apparent&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Where the careless glance but found, in expanses of plaster,</p>
<p>Touches of incoherent color and lines interrupted&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Somewhat still of the life of surpassing splendor and glory</p>
<p>Filling the frescos once; and here and there was a figure,</p>
<p>Standing apart, and out from the common decay and confusion,</p>
<p>Flushed with immortal youth and ineffaceable beauty,</p>
<p>Such as that figure of Eve in pathetic expulsion from Eden,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>Taking&ndash;&ndash;the tourist remembers&ndash;&ndash;the wrath of Heaven al fresco,</p>
<p>As is her well-known custom in thousands of acres of canvas.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>III.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I could make out the much-bepainted Biblical subjects,</p>
<p>When I had patience enough: The Temptation, of course, and Expulsion;</p>
<p>Cain killing Abel, his Brother&ndash;&ndash;the merest fragment of murder;</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s Debauch&ndash;&ndash;the trunk of the sea-faring patriarch naked,</p>
<p>And the garment, borne backward to cover it, fearfully tattered;</p>
<p>Abraham offering Isaac&ndash;&ndash;no visible Isaac, and only</p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s lifted knife held back by the hovering angel;</p>
<p>Martyrdom of Saint Stephen&ndash;&ndash;a part of the figure of Stephen;</p>
<p>And the Conversion of Paul&ndash;&ndash;the greaves on the leg of a soldier</p>
<p>Held across the back of a prostrate horse by the stirrup;</p>
<p>But when I looked at the face of that tearful and beauteous figure,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Eve in the fresco there, and, in Venice of old, Violante,</p>
<p>As I must fain believe (the lovely daughter of Palma,</p>
<p>Who was her father&rsquo;s Saint Barbara, and was the Bella of Titian),&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Such a meaning and life shone forth from its animate presence</p>
<p>As could restore those vague and ineffectual pictures,</p>
<p>With their pristine colors, and fill them with light and with movement.</p>
<p>Nay, sometimes it could blind me to all the present about me,</p>
<p>Till I beheld no more the sausage-legged Austrian soldiers,</p>
<p>Where they stood on guard beside one door of the Convent,</p>
<p>Nor the sentinel beggars that watched the approach to the other;</p>
<p>Neither the bigolanti, the broad-backed Friulan maidens,</p>
<p>Drawing the water with clatter and splashing, and laughter and gossip,</p>
<p>Out of the carven well in the midst of the court of the Convent&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>No, not even the one with the mole on her cheek and the sidelong</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>Look, as she ambled forth with her buckets of bronze at her shoulder,</p>
<p>Swinging upon the yoke to and fro, a-drip and a-glimmer.</p>
<p>All in an instant was changed, and once more the cloister was peopled</p>
<p>By the serene monks of old, and against walls of the cloisters,</p>
<p>High on his scaffolding raised, Pordenone<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> wrought at his frescos.</p>
<p>Armed with dagger and sword, as the legend tells, against Titian,</p>
<p>Who was his rival in art and in love.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>IV.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent18'>It seemed to be summer,</p>
<p>In the forenoon of the day; and the master&rsquo;s diligent pencil</p>
<p>Laid its last light touches on Eve driven forth out of Eden,</p>
<p>Otherwise Violante, and while his pupils about him</p>
<p>Wrought and chattered, in silence ran the thought of the painter:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;She, and forever she! Is it come to be my perdition?</p>
<p>Shall I, then, never more make the face of a beautiful woman</p>
<p>But it must take her divine, accurs&egrave;d beauty upon it,</p>
<p>And, when I finish my work, stand forth her visible presence?</p>
<p>Ah! I could take this sword and strike it into her bosom!</p>
<p>Though I believe my own heart&rsquo;s blood would stream from the painting,</p>
<p>So much I love her! Yes, that look is marvellous like you,</p>
<p>Wandering, tender&ndash;&ndash;such as I&rsquo;d give my salvation to win you</p>
<p>Once to bend upon me! But I knew myself better than make you,</p>
<p>Lest I should play the fool about you here before people,</p>
<p>Helpless to turn away from your violet eyes, Violante,</p>
<p>That have turned all my life to a vision of madness.&rdquo; The painter</p>
<p>Here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visions, visions, my son?&rdquo; said a gray old friar who listened,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Seated there in the sun, with his eye on the work of the painter</p>
<p>Fishily fixed, while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much have I envied your Art, who vouchsafeth to those who adore her</p>
<p>Visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and vigils.</p>
<p>I have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion,</p>
<p>Scourged myself almost to death, without one glimpse of the glory</p>
<p>Which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden.</p>
<p>Pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions:</p>
<p>Fain would I know how they come to you, though <i>I</i> never see them,</p>
<p>And in my thickness of hearing I fear some words have escaped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar,</p>
<p>Baleful, breathless, bewildered, fiercer than noon in the dog-days,</p>
<p>Round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur;</p>
<p>From the lips to the ears of those nameless Beppis and Gigis</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Buzzed the stinging whisper: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear Pordenone&rsquo;s confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well they knew the master&rsquo;s luckless love, and whose portrait</p>
<p>He had unconsciously painted there, and guessed that his visions</p>
<p>Scarcely were those conceived by the friar, who constantly blundered</p>
<p>Round the painter at work, mistaking every subject&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s drunken Debauch for the Stoning of Stephen the Martyr,</p>
<p>And the Conversion of Paul for the Flight into Egypt; forever</p>
<p>Putting his hand to his ear and shouting, &ldquo;Speak louder, I pray you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they waited now, in silent, amused expectation,</p>
<p>Till Pordenone&rsquo;s angry scorn should gather to bursting.</p>
<p>Long the painter gazed in furious silence, then slowly</p>
<p>Uttered a kind of moan, and turned again to his labor.</p>
<p>Tears gathered into his eyes, of mortification and pathos,</p>
<p>And when the dull old monk, who forgot, while he waited the answer,</p>
<p>Visions and painter, and all, had maundered away in his error,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For in my own,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;is such a combat of devils,</p>
<p>That I believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better</p>
<p>Than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover</p>
<p>Heights which I never can reach, and bright on the pinnacle standing</p>
<p>In the unfading light, my rival crowned victor above me.</p>
<p>If I could hint what I feel, what forever escapes from my pencil,</p>
<p>All after-time should know my will was not less than my failure,</p>
<p>Nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity.</p>
<p>All should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage,</p>
<p>Saying: &lsquo;Not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored;</p>
<p>His was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest achievement,</p>
<p>Conscious of doing his utmost, and knowing how vast his defeat is.</p>
<p>Life, if he would, might have had some second guerdon to give him,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>But he would only the first; and behold! Let us honor</p>
<p>Grief such as his must have been; no other sorrow can match it!</p>
<p>There are certainly some things here that are nobly imagined:</p>
<p>Look! here is masterly power in this play of light, and these shadows</p>
<p>Boldly are massed; and what color! One can well understand Buonarotti</p>
<p>Saying the sight of his Curtius was worth the whole journey from Florence.</p>
<p>Here is a man at least never less than his work; you can feel it</p>
<p>As you can feel in Titian&rsquo;s the painter&rsquo;s inferior spirit.</p>
<p>He and this Pordenone, you know, were rivals; and Titian</p>
<p>Knew how to paint to the popular humor, and spared not</p>
<p>Foul means or fair (his way with rivals) to crush Pordenone,</p>
<p>Who with an equal chance&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='indent18'>&ldquo;Alas, if the whole world should tell me</p>
<p>I was his equal in art, and the lie could save me from torment,</p>
<p>So must I be lost, for my soul could never believe it!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Nay, let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory,</p>
<p>Still, when I look on his work, my soul makes obeisance within me,</p>
<p>Humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>He who sleeps in continual noise is wakened by silence,</p>
<p>And Pordenone was roused from these thoughts anon by the sudden</p>
<p>Hush that had fallen upon the garrulous group of his pupils;</p>
<p>And ere he turned half-way with instinctive looks of inquiry,</p>
<p>He was already warned, with a shock at the heart, of a presence</p>
<p>Long attended, not feared; and he laid one hand on his sword-hilt,</p>
<p>Seizing the sheath with the other hand, that the pallet had dropped from.</p>
<p>Then he fronted Titian, who stood with his arms lightly folded,</p>
<p>And with a curious smile, half of sarcasm, half of compassion,</p>
<p>Bent on th&rsquo; embattled painter, cried: &ldquo;Your slave, Messere Antonio!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>What good friend has played this bitter jest with your humor?</p>
<p>As I beheld you just now full-armed with your pencil and palette,</p>
<p>I was half awed by your might; but these sorry trappings of bravo</p>
<p>Make me believe you less fit to be the rival of Titian,</p>
<p>Here in the peaceful calm of our well-ordered city of Venice,</p>
<p>Than to take service under some Spanish lordling at Naples,</p>
<p>Needy in blades for work that can not wait for the poison.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Pordenone flushed with anger and shame to be taken</p>
<p>At an unguarded point; but he answered with scornful defiance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are come, I see, with the favorite weapon of Titian,</p>
<p>And you would make a battle of words. If you care for my counsel,</p>
<p>Listen to me: I say you are skilfuller far in my absence,</p>
<p>And your tongue can inflict a keener and deadlier mischief</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>When it is dipped in poisonous lies, and wielded in secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; Titian responded, &ldquo;methinks that our friend Aretino<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></p>
<p>Makes a much better effect than either of us in that tongue-play.</p>
<p>But since Messer Robusti has measured our wit for his portrait,</p>
<p>Even <i>he</i> has grown shyer of using his tongue than he once was.</p>
<p>Have you not heard the tale? Tintoretto was told Aretino</p>
<p>Meant to make him the subject of one of his merry effusions;</p>
<p>And with his naked dirk he went carefully over his person,</p>
<p>Promising, if the poet made free with him in his verses,</p>
<p>He would immortalize my satirical friend with that pencil.</p>
<p>Doubtless the tale is not true. Aretino says nothing about it;</p>
<p>Always speaks, in fact, with the highest respect of Robusti.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>True or not, &rsquo;tis well found.&rdquo; Then looking around on the frescos:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, very good indeed! Your breadth and richness and softness</p>
<p>No man living surpasses; those heads are truly majestic.</p>
<p>Yes, Buonarotti was right, when he said that to look at your Curtius</p>
<p>Richly repaid him the trouble and cost of a journey from Florence.</p>
<p>Surely the world shall know you the first of painters in fresco!</p>
<p>Well? You will not strike me unarmed? This was hardly expected</p>
<p>By the good people that taught you to think our rivalry blood-red.</p>
<p>Let us be friends, Pordenone!&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent18'>&ldquo;Be patron and patronized, rather;</p>
<p>Nay, if you spoke your whole mind out, be assassin and victim.</p>
<p>Could the life beat again in the broken heart of Giorgione,</p>
<p>He might tell us, I think, something pleasant of friendship with Titian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly over the shoulder of Titian peered an ironical visage,</p>
<p>Smiling, malignly intent&ndash;&ndash;the leer of the scurrilous poet:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You know&ndash;&ndash;all the world knows&ndash;&ndash;who dug the grave of Giorgione.<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a></p>
<p>Titian and he were no friends&ndash;&ndash;our Lady of Sorrows forgive &rsquo;em!</p>
<p>But for all hurt that Titian did him he might have been living,</p>
<p>Greater than any living, and lord of renown and such glory</p>
<p>As would have left you both dull as yon withered moon in the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud laughed the listening group at the insolent gibe of the poet,</p>
<p>Stirring the gall to its depths in the bitter soul of their master,</p>
<p>Who with his tremulous fingers tapped the hilt of his poniard,</p>
<p>Answering naught as yet. Anon the glance of the ribald,</p>
<p>Carelessly ranging from Pordenone&rsquo;s face to the picture,</p>
<p>Dwelt with an absent light on its marvellous beauty, and kindled</p>
<p>Into a slow recognition, with &ldquo;Ha! Violante!&rdquo; Then, erring</p>
<p>Wilfully as to the subject, he cackled his filthy derision:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we here! More Magdalens yet of the painter&rsquo;s acquaintance?</p>
<p>Ah&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent6'>The words had scarce left his lips, when the painter</p>
<p>Rushed upon him, and clutching his throat, thrust him backward and held him</p>
<p>Over the scaffolding&rsquo;s edge in air, and straightway had flung him</p>
<p>Crashing down on the pave of the cloister below, but for Titian,</p>
<p>Who around painter and poet alike wound his strong arms and stayed them</p>
<p>Solely, until the bewildered pupils could come to the rescue.</p>
<p>Then, as the foes relaxed that embrace of frenzy and murder&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>White, one with rage and the other with terror, and either with hatred&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Grimly the great master smiled: &ldquo;You were much nearer paradise, Piero,</p>
<p>Than you have been for some time. Be ruled now by me and get homeward</p>
<p>Fast as you may, and be thankful.&rdquo; And then, as the poet,</p>
<p>Looking neither to right nor to left, amid the smiles of the pupils</p>
<p>Tottered along the platform, and trembling descended the ladder</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Down to the cloister pave, and, still without upward or backward</p>
<p>Glance, disappeared beneath the outer door of the Convent,</p>
<p>Titian turned again to the painter: &ldquo;Farewell, Pordenone!</p>
<p>Learn more fairly to know me. I envy you not; and no rival</p>
<p>Now, or at any time, have I held you, or ever shall hold you.</p>
<p>Prosper and triumph still, for all me: you shall but do me honor,</p>
<p>Seeing that I too serve the art that your triumphs illustrate.</p>
<p>I for my part find life too short for work and for pleasure;</p>
<p>If it should touch a century&rsquo;s bound, I should think it too precious</p>
<p>Even to spare a moment for rage at another&rsquo;s good fortune.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by the purblind flatterers who would persuade you</p>
<p>Either of us shall have greater fame through the fall of the other.</p>
<p>We can thrive only in common. The tardily blossoming cycles,</p>
<p>Flowering at last in this glorious age of our art, had not waited,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>Folded calyxes still, for Pordenone or Titian.</p>
<p>Think you if we had not been, our pictures had never been painted?</p>
<p>Others had done them, or better, the same. We are only</p>
<p>Pencils God paints with. And think you that He had wanted for pencils</p>
<p>But for our being at hand? And yet&ndash;&ndash;for some virtue creative</p>
<p>Dwells and divinely exists in the being of every creature,</p>
<p>So that the thing done through him is dear as if he had done it&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>If I should see your power, a tint of this great efflorescence,</p>
<p>Fading, methinks I should feel myself beginning to wither.</p>
<p>They have abused your hate who told you that Titian was jealous.</p>
<p>Once, in my youth that is passed, I too had my hates and my envies.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Sdeath! how it used to gall me&ndash;&ndash;that power and depth of Giorgione!</p>
<p>I could have turned my knife in his heart when I looked at his portraits.</p>
<p>Ah! we learn somewhat still as the years go. Now, when I see you</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>Doing this good work here, I am glad in my soul of its beauty.</p>
<p>Art is not ours, O friend! but if we are not hers, we are nothing.</p>
<p>Look at the face you painted last year&ndash;&ndash;or yesterday, even:</p>
<p>Far, so far, it seems from you, so utterly, finally, parted,</p>
<p>Nothing is stranger to you than this child of your soul; and you wonder&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I indeed then do it?&rsquo; No thrill of the rapture of doing</p>
<p>Stirs in your breast at the sight. Nay, then, not even the beauty</p>
<p>Which we had seemed to create is our own: the frame universal</p>
<p>Is as much ours. And shall I hate you because you are doing</p>
<p>That which when done you cannot feel yours more than I mine can feel it?</p>
<p>It shall belong hereafter to all who perceive and enjoy it,</p>
<p>Rather than him who made it; he, least of all, shall enjoy it.</p>
<p>They of the Church conjure us to look on death and be humble;</p>
<p>I say, look upon life and keep your pride if you can, then:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>See how to-day&rsquo;s achievement is only to-morrow&rsquo;s confusion;</p>
<p>See how possession always cheapens the thing that was precious</p>
<p>To our endeavor; how losses and gains are equally losses;</p>
<p>How in ourselves we are nothing, and how we are anything only</p>
<p>As indifferent parts of the whole, that still, on our ceasing,</p>
<p>Whole remains as before, no less without us than with us.</p>
<p>Were it not for the delight of doing, the wonderful instant</p>
<p>Ere the thing done is done and dead, life scarce were worth living.</p>
<p>Ah, but that makes life divine! We are gods, for that instant immortal,</p>
<p>Mortal for evermore, with a few days&rsquo; rumor&ndash;&ndash;or ages&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>What does it matter? We, too, have our share of eating and drinking,</p>
<p>Love, and the liking of friends&ndash;&ndash;mankind&rsquo;s common portion and pleasure.</p>
<p>Come, Pordenone, with me; I would fain have you see my Assumption</p>
<p>While it is still unfinished, and stay with me for the evening:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>

<p>After what happened just now I scarcely could ask Aretino;</p>
<p>Though, for the matter of that, the dog is not one to bear malice.</p>
<p>Will you not come?&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p class='indent6'>I listen with Titian, and wait for the answer.</p>
<p>But, whatever the answer that comes to Titian, I hear none.</p>
<p>Nay, while I linger, all those presences fade into nothing,</p>
<p>In the dead air of the past; and the old Augustinian Convent</p>
<p>Lapses to picturesque profanation again as a barrack;</p>
<p>Lapses and changes once more, and this time vanishes wholly,</p>
<p>Leaving me at the end with the broken, shadowy legend,</p>
<p>Broken and shadowy still, as in the beginning. I linger,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Teased with its vague unfathomed suggestion, and wonder,</p>
<p>As at first I wondered, what happened about Violante,</p>
<p>And am but ill content with those metaphysical phrases</p>
<p>Touching the strictly impersonal nature of personal effort,</p>
<p>Wherewithal Titian had fain avoided the matter at issue.</p>
